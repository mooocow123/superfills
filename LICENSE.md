# Introduction

##### Ignore this section if you are putting the License into a repository.

I declare that the Super Cow License is a thing.
It's a joke license, but I'll use it for all my purposes.

# License

Projects with this license must retain the above rules:
* This EXACT document should be copy-pasted into LICENSE.md!
* Executables made out of the project should first display this license before running.
* Any other project depending on the project should mention the original project.
* This license is completely OPEN-SOURCE! That means anyone can modify your project,
download your code, create a executable out of it and so on!
* The project will have to get reviewed by mooocow123 (The creator of this license) before he gives the license to you.

# IMPORTANT
Nope, your not going to get in trouble if you don't obey the rules!
It's a joke license!
OR IS IT?!?
