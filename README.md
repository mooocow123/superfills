# superfills
 Newly made node polyfills for the browser.
 
 ### Currently polyfilled modules
  We, for now are working on polyfilling node's fs module and the module object.
  We'll later go to path and event emitters and stuff.
  `require()` is already polyfilled.
 
 ### Is this going to be used in a module bundler?
  Absolutely not! Gulp is better than one of those things!
